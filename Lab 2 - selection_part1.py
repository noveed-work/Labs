# Steps 
#       1.	Add a new code page to your project. Call it selection_part1
#       2.	Create an IF statement to see if the person is equal 18 or over. 
#       a.	Display 'You are in category A' 
#       3.	Create an IF statement to see if the person is equal 16 or over.
#       a.	Display 'You are in category B' 
#       4.	Create another IF statement to see if the person is under 16 years of age.
#       a.	Display 'You are in category C' 
#       5.	Save and run your code and enter 19 for age.
#       6.	As you see, there are too many confusing messages!
#       Simple IF statements work fine but not in a chain of IF statements such as these.

#       Use elif
#       1.	Create an ifâ€¦elif statement to examine the age in one statement. Follow this pattern:
#       if person is 18 and over:
#        display message
#       elif person is 16 and over:
#        	display message
#       else:
# 	     display message
#       Note: You must start with the highest age value first.
#       2.	Save and run your code using different values for age.


age = int(input("What is your age?: "))

if age>=18:
    print("You are in category A")
elif age>=16:
    print("You are in category B")
elif age<16:
    print("You are in category C")
