#   Task 4 â€“ Input an Integer Between Two Limits
#   In this part you'll ask the user to input an integer between a minimum and maximum values.
# 	If the user fails to enter an acceptable value for three times then you stop asking!
#   1.	Add a new file: getInt.py and make it the startup file.
#   2.	Create two variables for the min and max values. 
#   Set two values for these variables such as 1 and 100.
#   3.	Write a while loop that attempts to get an integer from the user between the limits of min and max values.
#   4.	If the user has tried three times and fails then print None. 
#   If a valid value is entered, just end the loop and print its value.

#   Note: None is a valid keyword in Python which stands for Null.
